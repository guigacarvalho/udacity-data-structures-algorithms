# Worst Case Analysis

## Task 0
O(1) - Constant time. The Time complexity does not depend on the size of the input.

## Task 1
O(n) - Linear time. Considering n = sum of items in the calls and texts arrays.

## Task 2
O(n) - Linear time. Considering n = number of items in the calls array.

## Task 3
A - O(nlog(n)) - Loglinear time. Considering n = number of items in the calls array.
B - O(n) - Linear time. Considering n = number of items in the calls array.

## Task 4
O(n) - Linear time. Considering n = sum of items in the calls and texts arrays.
